    <p>
        Mysterious creatures (known simply as "Dukes") disguise themselves as shrubbery and run around having a jolly time. If discovered, they shed their disguise and laugh innocently at any human that happens to see them. </br>
        Fortunately for the hunter, there are a couple of tricks to finding dukes... and some of them are the dukes' own doing! Watch carefully for movement, since real shrubbery does not run about.</br>
        Also, be especially aware of the dukes' exploding decoys -- although the dukes designed them to destroy vegitation, they can easily backfire and destroy decoys, vegitation, and dukes alike!
